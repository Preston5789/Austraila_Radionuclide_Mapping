Converting the georeference data in the mmc dataset from UTM to Lat-Long

Note that geospatial data conversion is deeply arcane and complex; I am not attempting to explain all the acronyms, data sources and conversion equations here as I would simply be parroting information available from other sources.

Based on the information included in the dataset and the accompanying paper, I identified the georeference data as UTM coordinates with WGS84 as the datum (shape of the Earth, since it is not truly a sphere), and the sample points in Zones 52S and 53S (the zones indicate which part of a flattened map the coordinates lie).  

R uses the libraries rgdal and sp for the conversion of geospatial data.  To convert the Easting and Northing coordinates to lat-long required several steps.  Note that all these steps could be done with a single function; because of my lack of familiarity with this type of work I laid them all out one at a time and explicitly to make my troubleshooting easier.  First, I had to separate the data for Zones 52S and 53S as each utilizes a distinct transform.  Next, I had to convert the coordinates to a specialized type of dataframe, called a "Spatial Points Dataframe."  To do this required selecting a reference that would identify the coordinate system to R.  The systems for the UTM Zone 52S data is EPSG 32752, and Zone 53S is EPSG 32753.  

Once the dataframes are set up, the tranform is done to convert the original coordinates to EPSG 4326, which is standard lat-long format.  Then I recombined the data from the two Zones.  Now that the data is in lat-long, standard R routines from ggplot and ggmap libraries can be used to plot the data.
